                    <p>I really enjoy technology. I started making Wordpress sites as a hobby and now i can help to small businesses to reach they customers as a freelancer. I really like to traveling: to new places, concerts/festivals and adventures. As well as, exercising: enjoy going to the gym at least five times a week and reading: enjoying having a reading time.</p>
